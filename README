Description -
This is a utility script that selectively updates a wiki using another wiki's content, 
i.e. if you have a public and a private wiki where the public wiki has *only* partial contents of the private wiki,
this script can selectively fetch pages/images from your private wiki and import them to your public wiki.
Its needed to list all the pages to import in a file in separate lines.

Usage -
Just run this script after setting the settings (below).

--
Please set the settings in index.php at the top to point to your wikis
Example settings - 

$settings['privatewiki'] = "http://localhost/private";
$settings['publicwiki'] = "http://localhost/public";
$settings['user'] = "Nischayn22"; // A user who has all the privileges like file-deletion, file-uploading, etc
$settings['pass'] = "password";
$settings['file'] = "clientPages.txt";

Example - 
file named clientPages.txt has the following text:

Hello
Category:Id
File:Passportpics.jpg
